`ts-ci` is a project starter like [TSDX](https://github.com/formium/tsdx) or [typescript-starter](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter) but (arguably) better because:  
- It's not a CLI tool, the automation happens with Github Actions.  
  Update your `package.json` version number, push. Voila, your new version is published on NPM.  
- It doesn't bundle your library into a single file so users can cherry-pick what they want to import from your lib, your modules will be tree shakable.  
  E.g: `import { aSpecificFunctionÂ } from "your-module/aSpecificFile"`

# How to use

- Click on ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/127756563-ec5f2d07-d758-43f1-8fac-387847c0d064.png)
- The repo name you will choose will be used as a module name for NPM.
- Go to the repository ``Settings`` tab, then ``Secrets`` you will need to add a new secret:
``NPM_TOKEN``, you NPM authorization token.
- To trigger publishing edit the ``package.json`` ``version`` field ( ``0.0.0``-> ``0.0.1`` for example) then push changes... that's all !
- Publish beta release by setting your version number to `X.Y.Z-beta.T` (example: `1.0.0-beta.32`). You usually want to do that from a branch,
  it work as well! You just have to open a PR.
# Features

This template automates the boring and tedious tasks of:
- Filling up the ``package.json``
- Setting up Typescript.
- Testing on multiple Node version running on Ubuntu and Windows before publishing.
- Maintaining a CHANGELOG.
- Publishing on NPM and creating corresponding GitHub releases.

Besides, good stuff that comes with using this template:
- The `dist/` directory is not tracked on the ``main`` branch.
- Shorter specific file import path.  
  ``import {...} from "my_module/theFile"`` instead of the usual
  ``import {...} from "my_module/dist/theFile"`` 
- ESlint and Prettier are automatically run against files staged for commit. (Optional, you can [disable](#disable-linting-and-formatting) this feature)

# FAQ

  <summary>Click to expand</summary>  

## Can I use `npm` instead of `yarn`

Yes, just remove the `yarn.lock` file.
## What will be included in the npm bundle?

All filles listed in [the files property of your package JSON](https://github.com/garronej/ts_ci/blob/974054f2b83f8170317f2b2fa60b5f78e9336c0b/package.json#L35-L41).  

## How to debug the action

You can increase the verbosity by creating a new secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and setting it to true.

## Disable linting and formatting

Remove [this](https://github.com/garronej/ts_ci/blob/974054f2b83f8170317f2b2fa60b5f78e9336c0b/package.json#L15-L18), [this](https://github.com/garronej/ts_ci/blob/974054f2b83f8170317f2b2fa60b5f78e9336c0b/package.json#L20-L32) and [this](https://github.com/garronej/ts_ci/blob/974054f2b83f8170317f2b2fa60b5f78e9336c0b/package.json#L47-L53) from your `package.json`  
Remove [this](https://github.com/garronej/ts_ci/blob/974054f2b83f8170317f2b2fa60b5f78e9336c0b/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L12-L26) and [this](https://github.com/garronej/ts_ci/blob/974054f2b83f8170317f2b2fa60b5f78e9336c0b/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L29) from `github/workflows/ci.yaml`  
Remove `.eslintignore`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierignore` and `.prettierrc.json`.

## Accessing files outside the ``dist/`` directory

The drawback of having short import path is that the dir structure  
is not exactly the same in production ( in the npm bundle ) and in development.

The files and directories in ``dist/`` will be moved to the root of the project.  

As a result this won't work in production: 

``src/index.ts``
```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

const str = fs.readFileSync(
    path.join(__dirname,"..", "package.json")
).toString("utf8");
```

Because ``/dist/index.js`` will be moved to ``/index.js``

You'll have to do: 

``src/index.ts``
```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";
import { getProjectRoot } from "./tools/getProjectRoot";

const str = fs.readFileSync(
    path.join(getProjectRoot(),"package.json")
).toString("utf8");
```

With `getProjectRoot.ts` being:

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

function getProjectRootRec(dirPath: string): string {
    if (fs.existsSync(path.join(dirPath, "package.json"))) {
        return dirPath;
    }
    return getProjectRootRec(path.join(dirPath, ".."));
}

let result: string | undefined = undefined;

export function getProjectRoot(): string {
    if (result !== undefined) {
        return result;
    }

    return (result = getProjectRootRec(__dirname));
}
```

## How does the automatic ``CHANGELOG.md`` update works?

Starting from the second release, a ``CHANGELOG.md`` will be created at the root of the repo.

*Example:*  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6702424/82747884-c47a5800-9d9d-11ea-8f3b-22df03352e54.png)

The ``CHANGELOG.md`` is built from the commits messages since last release.

Are NOT included in the ``CHANGELOG.md``:
- The commit messages that includes the word "changelog" ( non-case sensitive ). 
- The commit messages that start with "Merge branch ".
- The commit messages that with "GitBook: "

*The GitHub release will point to a freezed version of the ``CHANGELOG.md``*:
